# How many green-colored agents to start the simulation? Ex. 600
num_green_agents: 600

# How many red-colored agents to start the simulation? Ex. 400
num_blue_agents: 400

# What will the final step number be? This is used when beginning a new simulation (mode: 0). Ex. 100
end_step: 30

# What are the dimensions (xyz) of the simulation space? Ex. [100, 100, 0]
size: [200, 200, 0]

# Do you want the agent values outputted to a CSV at each step? Ex. True
output_values: True

# Do you want an image produced at each step and a video at the end of the simulation? Ex. True
output_images: True

# What is the image width in pixels? Currently, default imaging is for a 2D space, though a 3D space
# will yield a bird's eye view of the space. Ex. 2000
image_quality: 2000

# What is the video width in pixels? This will scale the step images to the video resolution (using
# interpolation) to potentially reduce the file size of the video. Ex. 1000
