PythonABM makes complex agent-based modeling (ABM) simulations in Python accessible by providing an efficient base framework
for constructing ABMs. More information on PythonABM can be found below.

## 
### Installation
Assuming you have Python 3.7-3.10, the latest version of the PythonABM library can be installed using the following command.
```
pip install pythonabm
```

PythonABM can also be built from [source](https://github.com/kemplab/pythonabm) once downloaded from GitHub.
```
python setup.py install
```

### Running a simulation
Calling the start() method in the Simulation class will launch the ABM platform and run it as follows.
(See the ***example.py*** script as a template for building a simulation.) A
text-based UI will prompt for a ***name*** of the simulation and a corresponding ***mode*** (described below).
- 0: New simulation
- 1: Continue a previous simulation
- 2: Convert a previous simulation’s images to a video
- 3: Archive (ZIP) a previous simulation’s outputs

To avoid the text-based UI, the name and mode can be passed at the
command line by using flags (without the parentheses). Note: the
simulation file does not have to be named “main.py”.
```
python main.py -n (name) -m (mode)
```

When continuing a previous simulation (mode=1), the ABM will prompt for
the updated end-step number, though this can be passed like above.
```
python main.py -n (name) -m (mode) -es (end-step)
```

##

### NVIDIA CUDA support
For GPU parallelization, PythonABM requires a CUDA compatible GPU and NVIDIA’s
CUDA toolkit. If you don’t have the toolkit, download the
toolkit either directly from NVIDIA
[here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) or with [Anaconda's](https://www.anaconda.com/) conda
command show below.

```
conda install cudatoolkit
```
